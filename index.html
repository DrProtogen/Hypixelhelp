  Hi and welcome to my dumb little project ive been making for about 5 months. 
  My name is DrProtogen, I am a basic html coder and hypixel player. 
  Ive always wanted a good website that had the calender and a bazaar flipper calculator on the same website. 
  As soon as i found that Github had a free website thing I jumped on it and made this. 
  Now you are 100% bored of reading this text just press the Open button and find the things I put on this website, and have a good day!
